Django Nova is an open-source plugin that transforms your Django project into a flexible, Notion-like workspace.

With Nova, you can create pages, nested subpages, and modular blocks (text, images, lists) all stored in your Django database. Fully self-hosted, easy to extend, and perfect for developers who want structured content in their apps.

Premium features like Kanban, tables, and analytics are available in Django Nova Pro.
